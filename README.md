# Pizza-Sales-Analysis

# Introduction / Problem Statement:
Here the Pizza Dataset of Plato's Pizza store we would like to know the following:
What days and times do we tend to be busiest?
How Many Pizzas are we making during peak periods?
What are our best and worst-selling pizzas? 
What's our average order value?
How well are we utilizing our seating capacity? (we have 15 tables and 60 seats)

Objective:To analyze pizza sales revenue, identify trends, and provide insights to improve sales. 

# Tools and Technologies:
Programming Language: SQL

Libraries: pandas, numpy

Server: MySQL

Visualization Tools: Tableau, Jupyter Notebook, Excel

# Data Cleaning
We load and clean the data using Excel and check the columns data types.
And we check for null values in the data.
If null values are present we clean by adding the missing data or deleting the rows.
Changing the data types for better analysis of the data. For example this dataset has a column ‘order_date’ we need change this data type into the format ‘yyyy-mm-dd’.
